**_Automatic Plant watering System_**

This GitHub contains all relevant files used during development of our Automatic Plant watering System project for ECE 1000.


**Project Summary**

The Automatic Plant Watering System is designed to autonomously maintain the optimal moisture level for plants. It incorporates a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller, a Soil Moisture Probe, a Water Tank, Tubes, and a DC Motor Water Pump.

The primary goals of the system are to accurately measure the water level and moisture level of the soil using the Soil Moisture Probe. Based on these readings, the Raspberry Pi Pico determines whether water needs to be dispensed to the plants. If necessary, it activates the DC Motor Water Pump to deliver water through the Tubes from the Water Tank to the soil.Additionally, the system continuously monitors the water level to ensure plants receive adequate hydration.

Overall, the Automatic Plant Watering System provides a convenient and efficient solution for maintaining plant health by ensuring they receive the right amount of water at the right time.


<u>**Project Capabilities**</u>

The Automatic Plant Watering System Has several key capabilities including:

* Automated Watering: The system autonomously measures the moisture level of the soil and dispenses water as needed, ensuring plants receive optimal hydration without manual intervention.

* Precise Monitoring: Utilizing the Soil Moisture Probe, the system accurately gauges the water level in the soil, allowing for precise adjustments to watering frequency and duration.

* Continuous Monitoring: The system continually monitors the soil moisture level to maintain a consistent environment for plant growth. This ensures that plants are not overwatered or underwatered, promoting healthier growth.

* Low Maintenance: With its automated functionality, the system reduces the need for manual watering, saving time and effort for plant care.
